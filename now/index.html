        About to enter should have been my final semester of uni, but I just
        switched my second major from Data Science to Cybersecurity which
        annoyingly has one unit that I cannot complete till S1 2023.
      </p>

        Just started working as a software engineer at NGIS which I am extremely
        excited about. I did end up being the last person to leave on my first
        day, trigger the alarm system, and fail to figure out how to turn it
        off, prompting a company wide email the next day. Whoops.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also currently working on the Coders For Causes 2022 Winter Project,
        POOPS. Until semester starts proper I intend to carouse and read.
        Spent last week in Mandurah doing the former, spending this week doing
        the latter.
      </p>

        Currently learning Nest.js/Angular/Postgres for NGIS,
        Next.js/React.js/Firestore for CFC, and reading The Light Fantastic by
        Terry Pratchett. React is tempting me to rewrite this site, but I will
        try to resist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I just quit my job at Spritz after 5 years. Mario gave me some kind
        advice about not undervaluing myself in the future and then said
        something in Italian that made the whole resturant cheer when I said my
        final goodbye. I will miss them.
