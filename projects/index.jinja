        A list of "usable" things I have developed that are on the internet.
        The wiki has <a href="https://notes.zachmanson.com/projects">detailed writeups</a> on a few of these.
        I also have a list of more <a href="/projects/microprojects/">boring projects</a>. Most of these are <a href="https://github.com/zachpmanson">open source</a>.
