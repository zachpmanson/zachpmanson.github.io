I spend an inordinate amount of time reading arguments on the internet. Every now and then I'll find one that is actually thoughtful and in-depth. One with more kindness than usual, with genuine attempts to understand the perspectives of each other.

And after the arguing has concluded, the fighting parties express that they respect the other.

These are rare. But it isn't rare that upon finding one of these I will glance at the usernames.

Today I glanced at the usernames of two people having a beautiful argument on a forum:

`"euronforpresident"`

Fine, nice little Game of Thrones reference.

And their opponent:

`"Hitleresque"`
